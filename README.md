Given Dataset :https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z3Y_SBvSFsCapsfe47EAiEXfWLQUUnCf/view?usp=drive_link

Problem Statement:

A Company which was established a few years back is facing around a 15% attrition rate for a couple of years. And it's majorly affecting the company in many aspects. In order to understand why employees are leaving the company and reduce the attrition rate, we proposed conducting a HR analytics study. This data-driven approach will enable the company to make informed decisions, potentially reducing the attrition rate to below 10% within the next fiscal year and saving financial losses for the company and building a dashboard which can help the organization in making data-driven decisions.

Objective of the Project:

The primary objective of studying employee attrition is to identify the underlying causes and develop effective strategies to reduce turnover. By analyzing factors such as job satisfaction, work-life balance, compensation, and career development opportunities, organizations can gain insights into what drives employees to leave. This understanding enables the development of targeted interventions aimed at improving employee retention, enhancing organizational stability, and fostering a positive work culture.
